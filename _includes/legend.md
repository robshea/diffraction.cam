### How To Use This Table

- Select a <i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-camera-retro"></i> Camera. If your camera is not listed, [request to add it here](/cameras/).
- Select a <i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-waveform"></i> Filter. If a column is dimmed, that wavelength of light will not be transmitted by the selected filter.
  - Select `Full spectrum` when using a full spectrum converted camera with no additional filter. If you use a full spectrum camera with an additional filter, then select the filter used.
  - Select `Hot mirror or UV/IR cut` for an unconverted camera, as these contain a hot mirror filter, or when using a full spectrum camera with an added UV/IR cut filter.
- <i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-aperture"></i> Switch between (whole) ƒ-stops and (third) ƒ-stops.
- Select the row of the <i class="fa-duotone fa-light fa-aperture"></i> ƒ-stop you wish to shoot at.
